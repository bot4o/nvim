**Prerequisite:**
- Install ripgrep and nodejs (for the LSPs) on your system;
- Just to know how LazyVim works

0. Back up you old `./config/nvim`  configuration;
1. Install this [nvim](https://github.com/bot4o/nvim) repo to your config location:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bot4o/nvim ~/.config/nvim
    ```
2. Pretty much done. Just open nvim. It may have errors but you should run `:Lazy`  then press `S` to sync everything; 

### Windows
It should be the same as the Linux version
